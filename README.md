# Hotel Reservation System

# Introduction

This is a hotel reservation system used for employees of a hotel. Using Java and Postgresql, I created this project. 
Postgresql handles the tables in the database which allows information to be stored. Java is used to run the functions and modifying the tables. 
The project includes a way to add rooms and customers, update or delete customers, and a way to view rooms that have been taken.
I built this project because it was a way to test my Postgresql skills and to see what I could make with a database.

# Goals

My goal for this project was to make a system for hotel employees that allowed them to create rooms, customers, and view what rooms were taken.
I ended up adding more onto this such as the update and delete.

# Issues Faced

The biggest isssue I faced was learning how to combine Java with Postgresql. I spent quite a bit of time looking for ways to use my join statement in Java and trying to get it to work.
Another issue was that I was getting errors for a line of code that still did what it needed to do.

# Conclusion

In the end, I am proud of this project. This project feels like something I can come back to at any time and add new things. I will most likely come back later and use a framework so I can build a website with it.
